### Tutorial
There are currently 3 hands-on sections to this tutorial.

- The [first section](1_pretrained_vectors.ipynb) covers pre-trained word embeddings [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dpressel/dlss-tutorial/blob/master/1_pretrained_vectors.ipynb)

- The [second section](2_context_vectors.ipynb) covers pre-trained contextual emeddings [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dpressel/dlss-tutorial/blob/master/2_context_vectors.ipynb)
- The [third section](3_finetuning.ipynb) covers fine-tuning a pre-trained model [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dpressel/dlss-tutorial/blob/master/3_finetuning.ipynb)

### New!!

I have posted a set of [Colab tutorials](https://github.com/dpressel/mead-tutorials) using [MEAD](https://github.com/dpressel/mead-baseline) which is referenced in these tutorials.  This new set of notebooks covers similar material, including transfer learning for classification and taggers, as well as training Transformer-based models from scratch using the [MEAD API](https://github.com/dpressel/mead-baseline/tree/master/layers) with TPUs.  MEAD makes it easy to train lots of powerful models for NLP using a simple YAML configuration and makes it easy to extend the code with new models while comparing against strong baselines!
